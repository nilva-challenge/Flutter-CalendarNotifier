## Introduction

We want a simple app to get events of a specific calendar, and add events to it through google calendar APIs. It is consisted of a simple page which shows a lazy loaded list of events with following description:

- event description

- event name

- due date

- repeat

  

and also a floating action button in the bottom of page which opens a modal that gets the cited fields, and creates a new event (must be created in google calendar).

  

### Note

It is highly recommended to use flutter BLoC pattern.

  

## Expectations

  

So What does matter to us?

- a clean structure of codebase

- clean code practices

- getting familiar with state management practices & patterns

- finally & most important, ability to learn (this project is primarily a test to see how you can learn the things you do not know, so don't be afraid if you don't know a subject, that is our goal)

  

## Tasks

  

1. Fork this repository

2. Estimate the develop & send it to us

3. Break and specify your tasks in project management tool

4. Learn & Develop

5. Push your code to your repository

6. Send us a pull request, we will review and get back to you

7. Enjoy

  

**Finally** don't be afraid to ask something from your mentor

  

## My Experience

Since the goal was learning. let's see what we learned :

1.  [Flutter clean architecture & TDD](https://resocoder.com/flutter-clean-architecture-tdd/)  courtesy of [Reso Coder](https://resocoder.com/)

2. [Bloc ](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)State Management

3. Working with [google apis](https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis)

4. Auhenticating with [google_sign_in ](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package (Originally intended to use google_auth package, BUT surprisingly it spawns unnecessary web authentication while mobiles have google account built in. This approach should be used in web apps.)
